                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Video games have been present throughout my life, even if I do not remember my family had 
                  a Playstation 1, with which my sister and I got to play. But it was not until December 2007 
                  in which my parents gave us the Wii, with this console was that I really started to be 
                  interested in video games.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Since that time, many of the things I remember from my childhood and adolescence, have to 
                  do with video games, I played games like Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, TLoZ Twilight Princess, 
                  Kirby Epic Yarn, Super Smash Bros Brawl, Punch Out, Spider Man Web Of Shadows, and many more, 
                  I have also changed systems many times, Wii, Wii U, PC (Which currently I still use) and Nintendo Switch. 
                  In this blog I will show some of the games that throughout my life have inspired me the most and made 
                  me wonder, how do video games work? And have made me want to dedicate myself to video game development.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  I was instantly drawn to this game when I saw the first 5 minutes of gameplay. 
                  The music, the setting, and the art are all stunning and create a serene and evocative atmosphere. 
                  The game mechanics are not very complex or diverse, but they are enough to keep me engaged and interested 
                  in the game. I think the game does a beautiful job of portraying what grief is, at least for me. 
                  I was so moved by the game that I cried when I finished it for the first time.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  This game was a source of comfort and inspiration for me in very difficult moments emotionally in 
                  my life. It helped me cope with my own feelings and see things in a different way. That's why this 
                  game is in the top 5 of my favorite games ever.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before? It's one of the best ranked games on 
                  metacritic and with very good reason. For me, this game was one of the most replayed in the time of 
                  the Wii, because I loved their scenarios. They were colorful, creative, and full of surprises. At 
                  the time, I was fascinated by the idea of a “hub” which was changing as you were advancing in the 
                  game. It felt like a living world that was evolving with me. Add to this how much I marveled at the 
                  physics that the game had: the gravity of the planets and how to play with them. It was so fun and 
                  satisfying to jump, spin, and fly across the different worlds. The game also had a great soundtrack, 
                  memorable characters, and a charming story.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  With that combination, you make any child and adult playing this game marvel at it, and that's why 
                  this game is my top 4. It's a masterpiece of gaming that I will always cherish and recommend.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  When I was a kid and most of my adolescence I never saw, read or played anything related to the horror 
                  genre, I just couldn't stand it since I was always a very scary person. Still, the moment I saw this 
                  game in some videos, it caught my attention, and even though I couldn't stand the idea of playing 
                  a horror game (since I had already tried it before), I decided to play it anyway. And boy, was I 
                  surprised to play it.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Its atmosphere was what I loved above all, the house that you go up and down and that is increasingly 
                  twisting as you progress through the game simply enchanted me, in turn the music that accompanies 
                  you along the route of the house is also a masterpiece that expresses very well everything that 
                  happens throughout the game, its mechanics are not very complex, but it made me wonder how is it 
                  that in a game of this type the alerts and interactions with the environment are prepared, so 
                  that all the physical and sound changes occur in the environment that make the terror increase even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then horror in video games is one of the genres in which I have become more demanding to find 
                  something that I like, also it has inspired many ideas for projects that I have had throughout my life 
                  since I played it including <b><u><a href="schizophrenia-details.html">"Esquizofrenia"</a></b></u> 
                  which is one of the projects that is included in my portfolio, for these reasons is that it is the top 3 game.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  As with Super Mario Galaxy 2, there is nothing new I can say about this game that has not been said 
                  before, it is the best selling game in history and one of those that revolutionized the entire industry, 
                  and that personally for me, best defines what the word "video game" represents.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  From this game, what made me stay with it and that has probably been one of the games I have dedicated 
                  more hours to it, is to have played with my friends, you know those memes about the 2 weeks a year when 
                  you suddenly feel like playing minecraft? Well, with my group of friends it always happened and instead 
                  of 2 weeks it was 2 months. Something else that always caught my attention about the game, was how it was 
                  made in general, how the chunks of the game are rendered, how the redstone works and what has been done
                  with it, how the farms work and all the technical part, and how the way it is programmed to make it all work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For these reasons, for me, this is the top 2 game.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Oh boy oh boy, what can I not say about this game, I have to give you some context, to explain why 
                  this game is my all time favorite and above all, made me want to go into game development.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  At the time in which I had the Wii, one of the games that caught my attention when I played them was this, 
                  the Skyward Sword, many prefer or talk more about the Twilight Princess that in fact I also played, but 
                  there was something else that captured me in Skyward Sword, thanks to this I preferred to play it. But, 
                  at that time my Wii had a problem, I don't know why but there were times playing any game that out of nowhere 
                  the games just freeze, and there was not a single way to solve it, I never knew why, if it was a problem of 
                  the console or something else, but it always happened, every time I had to restart the console completely to 
                  play again and therefore, I ended up losing the unsaved progress in the games and I had to play again to the 
                  point where I had been and pray that it would work this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Specifically with Skyward Sword, apart from freezing in random parts of the game, it always always always 
                  always froze before the final sequence of the game, where you fight the last phase of Ghirahim and then 
                  release Demise. This always made me angry with the game, because I didn't understand why that was happening, 
                  and no matter how many times I tried, it always froze, I even tried to start the game from 0, praying that 
                  this time I was passing it, it would be the good one to finally complete the game. By the time I stopped 
                  having the Wii I ended up playing the game no lie 8 times, but none of those 8 times I could finish it, 
                  and I think that's what at the end of the day, made me fall in love with this game, it made me fall in love 
                  with each and every one of its characters and their interactions, wondering how they worked and how I had 
                  to wait for specific things to do or happen for them to talk about different things, it made me fall in love 
                  with each of its beautiful environments and the music that accompanied them, it made me wonder about every 
                  single aspect of the game and how they worked. It simply made me fall in love with the game and realize that 
                  I wanted to make video games and understand how they are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until recently I had the opportunity to play the full game for the remaster that Nintendo did to the game 
                  and I have a Nintendo Switch, and it has been one of the most beautiful experiences I've had in my life, 
                  to play this game again and remember my childhood and finally be able to pass it to me, made me realize 
                  that I really wanted to do this, develop video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And those, have been the reasons why Skyward Sword is my favorite game ever. I hope you liked this reading.
