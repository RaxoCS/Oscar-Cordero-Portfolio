                  Day by day people deal with dangerous situations, causing the brain to enter a state of 
                  alert inducing symptoms such as: nervousness, tremor, hyperventilation, lack of concentration, 
                  among others. Making people unable to continue with their daily activities no matter how easy 
                  they may seem to them. Thanks to this, applications have been created to try to deal with this 
                  problem, however, the charge requested from the user exceeds the budget limit and/or does not 
                  meet the user's quality standards. With this in mind, the "Relax XP" application arises, which 
                  aims to mitigate the problem that stress represents for the average user, implementing striking 
                  technologies such as virtual reality, making it accessible to the user thanks to its development 
                  for mobile devices, in turn, counting on its relevant research with professionals in the area of 
                  psychology to treat stress in a more effective and professional way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This application, which was made with the purpose of participating in contests of technological 
                  projects such as <u><b><a href="https://laredmex.org">EXPOCIENCIAS</a></b></u>, was designed in Unity, with the help of Google Cardboard technology, 
                  with this we could focus the application to the target audience we were looking for, which were 
                  people who may not have the economic stability to enjoy virtual reality experiences with vr sets 
                  like Oculus, but enough to buy a vr headset for the cell phone that did not exceed $400 mx ($25 dls).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The artistic style was decided with the help of professionals in the field of psychology, in 
                  meetings with them, we came to the conclusion that one of the techniques for people to reach a 
                  state of calm, is to connect with their "child self". This responds to what a child would most 
                  likely call his attention, among those things that could call his attention are styles such as 
                  the chosen one, which is Low Poly, this also helps people not to be even more overwhelmed by the 
                  situation they are living, by not having to process so much information to see their environment.

                  My main roles in this project were: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Project Manager: </b>I assumed the responsibility of preparing the documentation required for the 
                    contest in which I participated. In addition, I coordinated the agendas and drafted minutes with 
                    both the team members and the professionals with whom we collaborated. These steps were taken to 
                    provide the application with the necessary professional integrity and to ensure that it met its 
                    objectives effectively.
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <b>Game Programmer: </b>My fundamental responsibility included the development of the game 
                    logic, addressing crucial aspects such as the user's movement control, the transition between the 
                    different scenes, the implementation of the music, and the creation of elements that would enhance 
                    the player's experience, such as the water that is seen in the game. My work also included the task 
                    of testing and verifying that the game worked correctly, meeting the expected performance and 
                    gameplay standards, and ensuring that it met the expectations of the application's users.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <b>3D Environmental Artist: </b>My main function was to import and assemble the models designed 
                    by the 3D modeler, in order to create an environment that harmonized perfectly with the aesthetics 
                    we were pursuing in the project. This task, in particular, was the subject of extensive consultations 
                    with the psychologists with whom we collaborated, as it was a critical component for the achievement 
                    of the game's main objective. Ensuring cohesion and the right atmosphere in the environment was essential 
                    to the success of the project as a whole.
