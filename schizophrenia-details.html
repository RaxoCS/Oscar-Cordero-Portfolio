                  How could schizophrenia be shown in a game? In a way that represents the reality of 
                  the disease without losing the attention of the players and immersing them in an interesting 
                  one. From this question came the concept of Schizophrenia which was my first game development project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This game was a final project for a class of my career called visual programming, for 
                  this class I took a process of developing a video game in a very general way, from the 
                  creation of a basic GDD in which the story would be defined, the engine to use and if 
                  it would be 2D or 3D. Then it would be to develop the game to a playable demo which would 
                  be presented to participate in a Game Jam in which the 2 groups of the same quarter participated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development was carried out by 3 people including myself, and thanks to the work of 
                  each of the members we managed to deliver what you can see in the video at the beginning 
                  of this article and therefore win the Game Jam in 1st place among 15 other games that were 
                  presented that day.

                  My main roles in this project were:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Project Manager</b>I was the person in charge of carrying out the project, dividing the work 
                      in the team and reviewing the progress for delivery. This was my first project in which I took the role of Project Manager.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      <b>Game Designer: </b>Because the concept of the game, both its plot and its environment was mine, 
                      I was also in charge of the game design, in this role I had to conceptualize, implement and integrate 
                      the idea of the game to meet the expectations and goals we had.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      <b>3D Environmental Artist: </b>I was in charge of choosing and importing the models to use in the 
                      game, also to familiarize myself with the sculpting tools provided by Unity and get to the 
                      aesthetics that was intended for the game.
