                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  In the year 2021 when I was taking the subject Visual Programming, the teacher who 
                  taught us the subject decided to experiment that year giving us as a final project 
                  to develop a video game, which would end up being presented in an internal game jam 
                  between my group and the group that was taking the subject. In that game jam, my team 
                  won the first place with the project 
                  <b><u><a href="schizophrenia-details.html">"Esquizofrenia"</a></b></u>.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  The following year, with the groups that were below us, the teacher decided to do the 
                  same activity, and this time, because last year my team had won the previous game 
                  jam and the teacher saw that I was quite interested in the activity, she decided to 
                  invite me as one of the 2 jurors that graded the teams' games.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p class="mb-0">Qualification process</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  It was quite a fun experience, that year we were presented with a total of 8 games, 
                  which were very varied, we saw games from Pokemon style, through rogue lite to apocalyptic 
                  3D. The teacher was the one in charge of giving us the grading rubric for the projects, 
                  the aspects that were taken into account and qualified of the games were, mechanics, art, 
                  gameplay, future in the market, and the presentation of the game in the game jam. With these 
                  rubrics to analyze, it was quite fun to see how the different teams that participated in the 
                  game jam worked and completed the different goals.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  The winning game that year was a game about shrek, which was a kind of 2D dungeon crawler 
                  that had a very nice art, and also had an interesting gameplay, what surprised me in general 
                  of all the games presented was the quality, compared to the games presented last year at 
                  the game jam that I participated. At the end of the activity I asked the participants what 
                  were the difficulties they had faced during the development and if they liked the development 
                  of video games. In conclusion, most of them told us that it was much more difficult than 
                  they thought, since they encountered several obstacles throughout the development that made 
                  them almost unable to submit the game for the game jam.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  With this I could realize the passion I have for videogames, because at the end of it all I 
                  asked them if any of them at the end of this activity would like to continue researching and 
                  learning about videogame development (this also to recruit students for his then Dragon's Gleam group). 
                  To my surprise most of them said that video game development was not for them, for the reasons 
                  I explained above, and I understand, this world is sometimes so competitive and so difficult 
                  to overcome in certain aspects, that it is even scary to get into it, but for me, the passion 
                  I have for video games has helped me to move forward, and have the desire to continue learning 
                  and being part of the industry.
