                <h1 class="article-title">Being part of a band, it's not what you would think it is.</h1>
              </div>
              <div class="article-content">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  As a member of a band, naturally, one has to be used to the relationship with other people who are 
                  like a family, and in this family sometimes there can be problems and/or situations where one or more 
                  interests of the band come into play. Not only that, but you have to be used to criticism, both bad 
                  and good, and you have to learn to deal with it, take the good out of every criticism you get, 
                  improve what needs to be improved and move on.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Several of these types of situations I had to face in different bands and for different reasons, 
                  me being a drummer, I am one of the key parts of a song, I do not demerit the role of each of the 
                  other artists in a band, but, the drummer carries the baton in a song, dictates how fast or slow 
                  to play, and if the drummer is out of time, everyone else is. Not only is this true, but in compositions 
                  it also plays a very important role in giving a song a unique personality, if you do a very 
                  generic drum composition, the song will sound very generic. This is where the story I'm about to tell you comes in.

                  <p class="mb-0">The problem it self</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  To give you some context, this happened over the course of 2 weeks, at that time, my band and I 
                  had been talking about our next steps as a band, like how serious we were going to take this project, 
                  one of the topics that came up was writing our own songs, since, up to that point, the only thing we 
                  had played were covers. After an afternoon of talking we decided that we wanted to take this project 
                  to the next level by starting to compose on our own. That's when the problems started.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  My task was to start making drum compositions, based on the riffs that the 2 guitarists sent me, 
                  at the beginning, as a new drummer in the composition, I had no idea what I could do with the riff 
                  that they gave me to make it sound cool, to make it sound like the songs I like to listen to every 
                  day, my first action was to investigate creative processes to be able to compose in an easier way 
                  and to be able to reach a result that I liked, and that's what I did, after several hours scratching 
                  my head trying to make something that had me satisfied, when I gave it to my colleagues and gave me 
                  their opinion, it was not what I expected.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  To summarize a little, the opinion they had about the composition I had done was not very good, 
                  they had different opinions, both constructive and destructive, but they all had something in 
                  common, the drum composition had been quite far from what they had in mind. Listening to their 
                  opinions on the matter, I couldn't help but feel attacked by their comments, but, I could realize 
                  something key that was happening to us, and that is that there was no clear communication.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p class="mb-0">The solution was to improve communication clarity.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  When I realized this, I mentioned it to them, emphasizing the fact that if we continued in this way, 
                  the only thing we were going to achieve was to annoy each other, for not understanding the remarks 
                  we were making to each other. With this said, we were able to improve our communication channel a lot, 
                  they were sending me different riffs, now they were doing it with their expectations of what they wanted 
                  to achieve with those riffs, with this I could give them my opinion and feedback on what could be done 
                  to improve and what we could leave as they preferred, making the teamwork more fluid and comfortable to do.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Of course, the way I have told you this story has been a rather summarized one, but, my objective in 
                  telling you this story is to share with you something that has helped me to understand and improve my 
                  communication with others, even in difficult situations such as having to give and/or accept negative 
                  comments about something we have done or someone else has done.
